# What is REIMS?

REIMS supports the annual visual health campaigns run by non-profit [Partners for Visual Health](https://partnersforvisualhealth.org/). The original REIMS1 was developed prior to 2000 and has been in use for many years. REIMS2 was launched in 2022 and is a complete new version, which now is cloud-based and supports newer platforms. It has been extended with new features to make it easier to use.
