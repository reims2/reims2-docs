# Technical docs for the REIMS2 project

This is a collection of all the stuff that is needed for building a new version of the [REIMS](https://vosh.org/get-involved/vosh-fellow/suggested-reading/reims-system/) system.

It is a work in progress and is primarily a notekeeper for the developer. It contains information for understanding the old REIMS and help on setting up REIMS2.
