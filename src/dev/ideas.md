# Ideas

This is a page for collecting all the ideas I had.

## Ideas

Most of them are just nice-to-have and could be done after the rewrite as a QOL improvement.

- Lens measuring is done with digital devices as well, so it would be nice to automatically import it from there
- QR Code and prescription printing feature?
- Improve the Philscore with ideas from the philscore page
- Show reasons for philscore in UI, i.e. highlight high deltas, highlight spherical equivalents
