# How to use REIMS2

## Edit existing glasses

If glasses have been wrongly entered, it's possible to correct them. For that, switch to the "Edit" page and enter the SKU you want to change. Simply click on the value you want to change. A text field will open, where it's possible to enter the new value. Click "Save" to save the changes.

## Dispense glasses

After a match has been found and the glasses have been dispensed, it's important to mark them as dispensed in the database. Switch to the "Edit" screen, enter the SKU and click "Dispense". Instead of clicking the button it's also possible to hit ENTER. A message will show if the dispension was successful.

## Deleting or replacing glasses

If glasses are missing in the storage or remove old unused glasses from inventory, it's possible to delete them. Switch to the "Edit" screen, enter the SKU and click "Delete". You'll be asked to confirm that you really want to delete glasses. It's important not to confuse this with Dispense, because glasses are permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

## Other features

### Full offline support

As long as REIMS2 has been used at least once on a machine, it works fully offline from then on. Just open REIMS2 website in your browser and it'll load even though there's no internet connection. It'll display a banner at the top of the page that it is running offline. It's also possible to dispense and edit glasses with no connection. If you're back online and the browser is opened again, those changes will be automatically uploaded.

This makes it possible to use REIMS2 in remote areas where internet connection is not available. To keep the database up-to-date, it's still recommended to go online at least once per day. Adding new glasses is not possible offline, nor is creating reports.

This requires Chrome.

### Adding new glasses simultanously

With REIMS2 it's finally possible to simultanously add new glasses on multiple devices. This works out of the box and REIMS2 makes sure that there are no colliding SKUs.
